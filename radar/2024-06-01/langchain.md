LangChain is a framework designed to improve the development and deployment of applications that use natural language processing (NLP) models. For example applications like "question-answering", "chatbots" or "conversational agents" - often using RAG (retrieval augmented generation) pattern.

It is recognized for its ability to integrate various vector databases, language models and ai-platforms into applications and comes with helpful preconfigured "chains" for typical use-cases. It uses and integrates well know open-source libraries.
