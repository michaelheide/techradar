[Panda CSS](https://panda-css.com/) is a feature rich and highly versatile CSS-in-JS library that generates CSS at buildtime.
It provides a great developer experience without the disadvantages of runtime libraries.
It is framework agnostic, but unlike Stylex and Vanilla Extract it provides JSX specific features like `styled` function and style props on top of it.

Key Features:
- compatible with React Server Components
- no performance disadvantages compared to runtime libraries
- highly versatile
    - recipes and variants like stitches
    - framework agnostic
    - styled function to create ui components like stitches
    - style props like styled-system
    - utility classes like tailwind
- w3c compliant design system with tokens and utilities support 
- fully typed API

With a comprehensive documentation and great community support from the Chakra UI Team we see a lot of potential to become one of the best CSS-in-JS libraries in the future.
